## Note

When [Spandana Nallapati](https://github.com/drsnallapati), [Ali Wojcikiewicz](https://github.com/aliwojo), [Annie Cho](https://github.com/skai233) and I built this game for our capstone project at the Grace Hopper Program, we included logins and a database that stored players' scores in order to analyze their progress in learning Regex. While this was an important aspect of our project, I've forked and edited our repo here in order to more easily show off the gameplay. For anyone interested in RegExtris in its original form, you can play that [here](https://regextris.herokuapp.com/) and view the original repo [here](https://github.com/SA3-Games/RegExtris).

RegExtris takes the classic game of Tetris and makes it into a learning and practicing environment for regular expressions. Learning to use regular expressions can be a daunting task and often programmers tend to leave it in the "I'll just google it when I need it" but having a basic understanding of the power of regex can take that google search to a much complex place. If you're comfortable with regex already, you can dive in and play or if you need a bit more guidance then you can use the learn mode to get your bearings first.
